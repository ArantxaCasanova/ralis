# Reinforced Active Learning for Image Segmentation (RALIS)
Code for the paper [Reinforced Active Learning for Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06583)

## Dependencies 
- python 3.6.5
- numpy 1.14.5
- scipy 1.1.0
- Pytorch 0.4.0

## Scripts
The folder 'scripts' contains the different bash scripts that could be used to train the same models used in the paper, for both Camvid and Cityscapes datasets. 
- launch_supervised.sh: To train the pretrained segmentation models. 
- launch_baseline.sh: To train the baselines 'random', 'entropy' and 'bald'.
- launch_train_ralis.sh: To train the 'ralis' model.
- launch_test_ralis.sh: To test the 'ralis' model. 

## Datasets
